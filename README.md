# üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements
The code was run on Python 3.12.3 on both a macOS and Ubuntu system.

This project requires the installation of 
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)&nbsp; (installed via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make))
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (installed through this project's make file, see [Usage](#usage))

<a name="usage"></a>

# ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
You can run the code using the [makefile](makefile) (requires `make`, which can be installed via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make)):
```bash
make run-project
```

This command installs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on macOS/Linux and sets up a virtual environment with the required Python dependencies.

If you prefer to run your own installation of uv (or already have it installed), you can run only the code directly:
```bash
make run-code
```
Note: This does not execute stats.rmd. To run that file, you will need R and R Markdown installed. It must be run separately.
